I work as a Data Analyst at Etsy with our search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. In summer 2016, I completed Metis’s three-month, full-time Data Science Bootcamp, where I did several data science projects, ranging from using random forests to predict successful projects on DonorsChoose.org to building an application in R Shiny that helps data science freelancers find their best-fit jobs. Before Metis, I graduated in June from INSEAD with a Master’s degree in Management (specialization in Organizational Behavior). I also earned my bachelor’s degree from Rice University in Decision Sciences, an interdisciplinary major I designed that focused on understanding how people behave and make decisions.


#### Brooke Watson

Brooke Watson is a Research Scientist at EcoHealth Alliance, where she studies how the environment affects infectious disease emergence and transmission. In her work, Brooke applies epidemiological methods to study the distribution and determinants of diseases in both humans and wildlife. Brooke uses R to build economic models of the cost of pandemics, map the spatial distributions of zoonotic outbreaks, and identify health risk factors in different populations. Brooke swam for the University of Tennessee in college and earned her Masters degree in Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. 


#### Jasmine Williams

Jasmine Williams is a graduate of the Masters of Science in Biostatistics at the Mailman School of Public Health and graduated from City University of New York – Hunter College in May 2014 with a BA in Mathematics. She first became interested in biostatistics and its applications to minority health and health disparities research during the Columbia University summer program in 2013. She worked with Dr. Jose Luchsinger and Dr. Dana March (both affiliated with the Northern Manhattan Center of Excellence on Minority Health and Health Disparities) on a project entitled “Discrimination and Depression among Urban Hispanics with Poorly Controlled Diabetes” where the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and its impacts on mental health due to experiences of discrimination was investigated. She has continued this type of work at Columbia University’s Biomedical Informatics and Biostatistics departments on a project called “Mobile Diabetes Detective” which is a web-based application that aims to help individuals manage their health and currently a statistician at ActiveHealth Management.
