## Details

If getting more involved with your local R-Ladies New York chapter was on your list of 2021 resolutions, here’s your chance! We are looking for new members to join us as event organizers on the R-Ladies NYC Board.

This information session will be a meet and greet with current board members: we’ll introduce ourselves, explain responsibilities and the expected time commitment of a board member, and highlight initiatives we’d like to pursue in 2021. We will also provide next steps for how to get involved. We are happy to take questions and suggestions for future meetups from our community, so please feel free to attend with feedback even if you may not be interested in joining the board as an organizer.

If you are interested in joining the board but are unable to attend this meeting, please connect with us via Slack or email us at nyc@rladies.org with your questions, thoughts, and comments. We’ll be happy to follow up with more information!

This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event. We will request your email address upon registration to ensure you receive the Zoom passcode on the day of the event.
