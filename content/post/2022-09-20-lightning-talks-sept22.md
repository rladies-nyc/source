## Details

Fill out this brief form by Thursday, September 1st to submit your application to be a speaker!
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vXC-iKiqCycnwD4sjqYMm9BgIOITHEvsPPdZBrVlEjg/edit

Lighting talks are five minute talks. You can talk about anything R, Tech, and/or Data Science related. Looking for ideas? How about talking about a cool package you found, how you use R in your company, a favorite learning resource, your journey into Data Science, or a side project you've been working on?

We would especially love to hear from people who've never presented at a meetup or conference before and/or those who still don't feel confident speaking publicly. A lightning talk can be a great way to start out speaking, as it's quick, low-prep, and fun!

Interested in proposing a talk but want to brainstorm ideas, get feedback, or some encouragement? We're here to help! You can join the #lightningtalks channel in our slack channel or email nyc@rladies.org. We would be happy to set up a time to talk with you!
