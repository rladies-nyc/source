--- Talk Abstract ---

Abstract:
In this talk, I'll take you behind the scenes of how visual journalism works on the day to day. I'll talk about the tools we use, the challenges and rewards of journalism, and show the process of developing a visual story. I'll also discuss my own journey of being self-taught in data visualization and going from academia, to business, to journalism.
