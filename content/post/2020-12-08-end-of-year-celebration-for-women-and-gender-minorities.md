## Details

[Please note: At the request of members of our community for an R-Ladies space exclusively for minority genders, this event is limited to those who identify as such (including but not limited to women, trans men, non-binary, and gender nonconforming individuals). Male allies have been great supporters of our chapter and the R-Ladies mission to promote gender diversity in the R Community -- for which we are grateful! -- and we believe the best way male allies can support us this month is by honoring the need for and benefit of such a space.]

Happy Holidays! To close out 2020, we are thrilled to host a virtual version of our annual end-of-year celebration and social! We'll utilize breakout rooms to allow participants to connect (or re-connect) with other members of our community in smaller groups.
