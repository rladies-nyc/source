--- Talk Abstract ---

"Tidyverse vs. Base R"
Speaker: Dorota Biedzio

Abstract: The rivalry between base-R and the tidyverse ends now! We will discuss the pros and cons of each, and compare code snippets to finally choose a winner! Or... instead... we can have an intellectual, even-tempered discussion because we are all professionals.


"Batch Processing R Markdown Reports"
Speaker: Alyssa Goldberg

Abstract: I'll be showing folks how to use R and RMarkdown to batch generate several reports at once - sort of like facet_wrap() but for
Word documents.
