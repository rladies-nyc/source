--- Talk Abstract ---

"Focus on Content: Create Enterprise-Worthy Shiny Applications with Periscope"
Speaker: Dr. Connie Brett

Abstract: The periscope R package is a framework that you can use to significantly speed up your shiny development – whether you are just writing your first collaborative application or taking on a bigger project that will be deployed to many users. Periscope can significantly "up" your Shiny game by jump-starting development in a way that is flexible and robust. This lets you focus on the content of your application, as opposed to the mechanics (and those insidious pitfalls!) of building a shiny application for multiple users.
