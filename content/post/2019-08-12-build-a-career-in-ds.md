R-Ladies NYC is proud and excited that one of our members, [Emily Robinson](https://hookedondata.org/), is co-authoring a book with a fellow R-lady, [Jacqueline Nolis](https://jnolis.com/writing.html)! The book, [*Build a Career in Data Science*](http://bestbook.cool), is available for pre-order, which comes with online access to all currently available chapters (1-9) access to the rest of the chapters as they come out. This book is a practical guide to preparing for, finding, and excelling in a data science role. It's written by two influential people in the R and data science communities and includes interviews from other data scientists, such as Brooke Watson, one of the R-Ladies NYC board members.
