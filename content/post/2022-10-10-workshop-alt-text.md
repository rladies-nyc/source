For our October Meetup, we welcome Liz Hare, who will lead a workshop titled "Writing Meaningful Alt-Texts for Data Visualizations in R."

Alt-text is important to incorporated into your work not only to adhere to accessibility laws but also to ensure your work reaches everyone.

During the workshop, Liz will give the audience an opportunity to share their own data visualizations and discuss how they could be improved with alt-text. So, **please bring a data visualization to share with the group!**
