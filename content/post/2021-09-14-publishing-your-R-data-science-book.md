--- Talk Abstract ---

Abstract: In this very practical and interactive workshop, four book editors from Chapman and Hall/CRC will discuss why you should consider publishing an R or Data Science book and why you should work with CRC. The editors will go over the publishing process and provide best practices for shaping your ideas and submitting a book proposal; discuss their bestsellers and popular series as well as emerging topics and trends. The lively discussion will provide plenty of opportunities for the attendees to ask questions and discuss ideas.
