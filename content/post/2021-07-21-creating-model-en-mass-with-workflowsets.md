--- Talk Abstract ---

Abstract: The tidymodels packages allow users to create and optimize models and their pre-processing steps (e.g. PCA, feature encodings, etc). With new data, it is common to try a variety of models to determine what works best. The workflowsets package enables users to easily evaluate, rank, and even combine (with the stacks package) myriad combinations of models and pre-processors. the community.
