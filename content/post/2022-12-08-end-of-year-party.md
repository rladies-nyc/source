Happy Holidays! Come celebrate how far R-Ladies New York has come this year at this fun, end-of-the-year social at Whiskey Ward. This event will be in-person, and a great gathering to close out our year!

We want to thank you all for your incredible support and for being part of the R-Ladies community. We hope to see you there!

Drinks will be available for purchase. Dress in casual or holiday gear - we welcome it all!
