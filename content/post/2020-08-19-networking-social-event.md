Though we'll be remote at least through the end of 2020, R-Ladies NYC doesn't want to lose the magic of meetups, where we get to network, socialize, meet new people, and make connections. For our August meetup, we'll be hosting a networking social event where we'll utilize breakout rooms to allow participants to connect (or re-connect) with other members of our community in smaller groups.

This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page and sent to all attendees at noon on the day of the event. 


## Agenda:

7-7:10: Welcome and R-Ladies NYC Announcements

7:10-8:30: Breakout room chats (3-5 people, and we'll provide some topics if that helps!)
