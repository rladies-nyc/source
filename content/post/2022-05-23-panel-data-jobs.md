## Details

We’ve all been reading about The Great Resignation in the news and how the pandemic has utterly changed the way we think about our professional selves. So how does that apply to current data workers, recent college graduates, and career changers. In this panel discussion, we are thrilled to be joined by Rachel Cohen and Shivani Sood to share their expertise on how to navigate a job search for every stage of your career pathing.
