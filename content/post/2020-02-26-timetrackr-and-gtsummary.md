## **Title:** It’s Time to Shine with the timetrackR App
## **Presenter:** Jessica Lavery

**Abstract:** While tracking time may seem like a mundane task that in and of itself consumes your time, if monitored and assessed regularly it can be useful to create a record of your work and to identify potential areas for improving efficiency. The timetrackR Shiny app provides a high-level summary of active, inactive and upcoming projects, as well as visualizations for the percentage of time spent by project or project investigator, number of hours spent on each project, and a timeline framing each project’s trajectory from planning through analysis and manuscript preparation. With the option to filter by year, investigator and analyst, the app is versatile enough to use for an individual or for an entire team as well as for use on a regular basis and for year-end or longer-term reviews of how time was spent. I will highlight the key features of the app and demonstrate how to integrate into your current workflow.

**Bio:** Jessica Lavery is a Biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. She has an MS in Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2014) and as of Fall 2019 is also pursuing a doctorate in public health (DrPH) in Biostatistics at Columbia University. Her research focuses primarily on retrospective analyses using institutional and claims data sources. She also serves as the[masked] Volunteer Coordinator for the Caucus for Women in Statistics.

## **Title:** Creating publication-ready and reproducible analytical tables with gtsummary
## **Presenter:** Margie Hannum

**Abstract:** A critical aspect of many data analysis projects is presenting tables of summary statistics and regression model results. However, summarizing results into publication-ready tables often requires a lot of extra code to customize (e.g. create reference line for categorical variables, format p-values a certain way, bold variable labels, merge multiple model results into one table, etc.). The {gtsummary} package provides an elegant and flexible way to make summary and analytic tables in R. Written as a companion to the {gt} package from RStudio, the {gtsummary} package summarizes data sets, regression models, and more, using sensible defaults with highly customizable capabilities. It also allows you to pull values straight from these tables for use in inline text so that every portion of your R markdown analysis report is reproducible. This talk will go over the functionality of the {gtsummary} package, and how you can use it to create beautifully formatted, ready-to-share summary and result tables in a single line of R code.

**Bio:** Margie Hannum is a Biostatistician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Her research collaborations largely involve using multi-modal genomic and single cell data to characterize cancer subpopulations. She contributes to the {gtsummary} package and uses it every day in her analysis pipelines. Twitter: @Margaret_Hannum
