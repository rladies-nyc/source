## Talk:

Everyone wants their code to run faster and there are numerous ways to achieve this goal. We start by looking at popular packages `dplyr`, `data.table` and `purrr` and the corresponding parallel implementations. We then turn our attention to writing simple C++ functions integrated into R, both sequentially and in parallel. We also build a `data.frame` aggregation function, starting sequentially, ending in parallel. Throughout this talk we see how to speed up code by running in parallel, locally and across nodes, in R and C++, all within the friendly confines of RStudio.
