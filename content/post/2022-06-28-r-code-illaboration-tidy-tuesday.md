We ask participants to pick a TidyTuesday dataset from the month of May or June and create (or attempt to create!) a visualization of the dataset before the meetup. At the meetup, participants will have the opportunity to:

**Share something you learned in making the TidyTuesday**

* Did you learn a new function in the process?
* Did you discover a new package?
* Did you learn something new with the data you explored?

**Share your process or tips for making the TidyTuesday**

* What TidyTuesday tips do you have?

**Share something you struggled with**

* What is a barrier you ran into while trying to create your TidyTuesday? We will work together to answer questions people ran into

**Share your visualization!**

* We will showcase the visualizations and works-in-progress we made with each other!

Even if you don’t have time to work on a #TidyTuesday before the meetup, **we hope you will still join us to collaboratively learn and code with each other!**

**What is #TidyTuesday?**

TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project hosted by the R for Data Science community. Every Tuesday a new dataset is posted, and everyone is invited to explore and visualize the data. “The intent of Tidy Tuesday is to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills” (TidyTuesday repository on GitHub https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

**How can I see what other people have created?**

People will often post their final TidyTuesday creations on twitter with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
