It has been four years since we did an open call for a new R-Ladies logo, which means R-Ladies NYC is in the market for a new look! We are excited to announce a new R-Ladies NYC logo contest. Please email your submissions to [nyc\@rladies.org](mailto:nyc@rladies.org){.email} with the subject line "hex sticker design". Submissions are due by the end of January and we will hold a public vote during the first two weeks of February. The winner will be announced on Valentines Day.

The R-Ladies font is Open Sans and the colors are #88398a (purple) & #a7a9ac (grey). Check the [R-Ladies Global repository](https://github.com/rladies/branding-materials/tree/main/logo) for reference. You are welcome to use any tool you desire!

Below are a few examples of other chapter's logos for inspiration:
