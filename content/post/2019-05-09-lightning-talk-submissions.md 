R-Ladies NYC are excited to be hosting an evening of lightning talks on Wednesday June 19! We held this event last year and it was a tremendous success, so we are really excited about the event this year! 

Lighting talks are five minute talks. You can talk about anything R, Tech, and/or Data Science related. Looking for ideas? How about talking about a cool package you found, how you use R in your company, a favorite learning resource, your journey into Data Science, or a side project you've been working on? 

We would especially love to hear from people who've never presented at a meetup or conference before and/or those who still don't feel confident public speaking. A lightning talk can be a great way to start out speaking, as it's quick, low-prep, and fun! 

Interested in proposing a talk but want to brainstorm ideas, get feedback, or some encouragement? We're here to help! You can join the #lightningtalks channel in our slack channel or email nyc@rladies.org. We would be happy to set up a time to talk with you!

To celebrate the diversity in the R Community, we're limiting presenters to those who identify as a minority gender (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender).
