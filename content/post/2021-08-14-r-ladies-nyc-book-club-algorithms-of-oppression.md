## Details

For our August book club, we will be discussing "Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism" by Safiya Umoja Noble.

**Important Update**: While this month's Book Club was originally scheduled to be in person, in light of oppressive heat this week in NYC and expected thunderstorms throughout the afternoon of Saturday, August 14th, this will now be an online event. The zoom link will be available on this page Saturday morning, and a message with the meeting passcode will go out at that time.
