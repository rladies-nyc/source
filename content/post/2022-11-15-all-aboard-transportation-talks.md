**Title: Building a Data Science Practice & a Data-Driven Business from the “Ground Up”: The Evolution of a Team, a Company, and Myself**

Abstract: Being the first IC hire at a company is a lot of things, but there’s some main things that it’s been:

* it’s challenging - there’s a lot happening, and there’s not always a lot of people to support the work
* it’s exciting - your work matters. there’s a ton of influence & reach that your work has
* it allows for opportunities of reflection - there’s typically a lot of growth in a short period of time, so it’s easy to see how far the business has come, how far the team has come, and how far your personal growth has come

In this talk, we’ll explore the evolution of data science & decision making at Revel from several different points of view (team practices, decision making processes, and personal philosophies / work styles).

Bio: Mikaela has a Master’s degree in Mathematics with over 5 years of experience in data science & analytics. She has worked across multiple industries with a focus on implementing data-driven strategies and measurement. In her current role at Revel, she is the technical lead for consumer data science & analytics on the rideshare business.


**Title: Centralizing external reporting via metrics.mta.info**

Abstract: As a public agency, the MTA shares a lot of data! I will overview the past, current, and future situation of MTA’s public performance metric reporting and how our recent launch of metrics.mta.info (beta) attempts to solve for some of the issues. I will briefly go into more detail about how the site was developed using the python package Streamlit and our plans to make the entire site open source.

Bio: Lisa Mae Fiedler is Acting Manager of Reporting and Analytics for the MTA. She leads MTA’s open data program and is working to revamp data-driven reporting for the agency.
