## Details

If you ever wanted to be more involved with your local R-Ladies New York chapter, it's not too late! We are looking for new members to join us as event organizers on the R-Ladies NYC Board.

This information session will be a meet and greet with current board members: we’ll introduce ourselves, explain responsibilities and the expected time commitment of a board member. The application for new board members is now available (due Sunday, November 20th): https://forms.gle/owAthwN8crL6CcZe9

We are happy to take questions and suggestions for future meetups from our community, so please feel free to attend with feedback even if you may not be interested in joining the board as an organizer.

If you are interested in joining the board but are unable to attend this meeting, please connect with us via Slack or email us at nyc@rladies.org with your questions, thoughts, and comments. We’ll be happy to follow up with more information!

This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page on the day of the event. We will request your email address upon registration to ensure you receive the Zoom passcode.
