## Details

Join us for a collaborative exploration of the [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) dataset of the week! First, we will have a short demo of working through a previous Tidy Tuesday dataset, led by Ludmila Janda. Then we will work in groups to do some exploration and visualization of the dataset of the week and then we will come together to share our work. No preparation is necessary but participants are welcome to check out the dataset(s) and come with any ideas they may have.
