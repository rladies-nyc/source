We are excited to announce that we are holding open submissions for an R-Ladies NYC logo for hex stickers!

Design notes: the R-Ladies font is Open Sans and the colors are #88398a (Purple) & #a7a9ac (Gray), though the logo can use variants of these colors and other colors. Here is the repo for the R-Ladies logo as a reference. Also, the hexSticker package is useful, but you are welcome to use any tool you desire!

Please email your submissions to nyc@rladies.org with the subject line "hex sticker design". We will hold a public vote for the logo!

Here are some examples for inspiration:
