To ensure that our Meetups are accessible for all members of our community, we ask you to please review and implement the below presentation recommendations. Let us know if you have any questions.

Please email your slides to nyc@rladies.org by noon the day before your talk, or provide the link where you have them available online. It is fine if they represent a draft at this point, although let us know that -- in the event that someone requests the slides ahead of the Meetup for accessibility reasons, we’d like to be able to share them. 


**Presentation Preparation**
* Slides created via R Markdown are more accessible (see Accessible R Markdown Documents) for people using screen reading software and therefore preferred over PowerPoint, PDF, and Google Slides. If you must use one of the latter, please take advantage of the accessibility features and accompany all slides with presenter notes and image alt text descriptions (see here). 

* Please add alternative text to your graphics, images, memes, and screenshots, in which you describe a graphic’s essential features in detail. For more information about writing alt text descriptions, see How to Create Alternative Text for Images for Accessibility and SEO and New in knitr: Improved accessibility with image alt text.

* Use color schemes that are colorblind friendly (see for example the viridis and RColorBrewer packages for palettes, and colorBlindness and colorblindr for simulation of colorblindness in figures to check them).

* Use a large sans serif font (minimum 22 point) on slides, and resize pictures to ensure they can be seen from smaller screens.

**Presentation Tips**
* As best as possible, please present your talk in a quiet, well-lit environment.

* Avoid vague wording like “here” or “this” that can’t be interpreted without seeing gestures.

* If presenting a code demonstration, explicitly share where you are in the script (e.g. line number) when working through it. If you deviate from the prepared materials, please articulate exactly what is being changed in your code so the audience can follow along.
Schedule breaks during long workshops/presentations (maybe in the middle)

* Care needs to be taken with animations and things that flash, which can cause seizures and migraines (see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Seizure_disorders))
